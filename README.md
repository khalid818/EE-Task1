# First task in electronics engineering path
Hello! This's my first task in electronics engineering path, I will connect each of the 8 servo motors to the breadboard and ensure each servo signal wire is connected to the appropriate pin on the Arduino then The servos will move to 180 degrees and 90 degrees, then return to 0 degrees after a delay of 1500 milliseconds.
